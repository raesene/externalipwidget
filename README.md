Just playing around with electron and a handy thing I'd like to have is an app that tells me what my Internet facing IP address is and lets me specify an IP which is "VPN" and then changes the icon colour if I have that IP address.

This code will be comically bad while I work out how all this works.  Do not whatever you do use this as a basis for anything else
